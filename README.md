Repository for the required project files/scripts

As a requirement for the Data Science- Data Cleaning Course, this repo contains:
1. CodeBook.md, 
2. run_analysis.R, 
3. as well as the final product of data cleaning project, Dataclean.txt 

##1. CodeBook.md outlines all the steps taken in data handling and manipulation including:
-download of data from: 
https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fproject􀃒les%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip
-saving the datasets into local directory and unzipping the downloads
-reading the downloaded files
-combining the datasets
-giving variable names and converting them to descriptive format
-merging all the datasets into a single data frame
-creating a second clean tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject 
-saving the final tidy data set as a .txt file

##2. run_analysis.R
This file contains the code that does all that is described in the CodeBook.md

##3. DataClean.txt is the ultimate result of the data cleaning project that contains a tidy dataset.
